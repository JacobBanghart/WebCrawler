## WebCrawler
This is my specific implementation of https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGA8Vys-f48mAH9OKSUyav0q The New Boston's web crawler. I had some specific modifications I needed to make and to specifically catalog external links going out of a specific website. 

## Running
Clone the repo and `python3 main.py`  

This project has no external dependanices so you should not need anything but python3.

## Developing
Gl have fun this is just for me to run and share with others so not much active development will be done here so fork to your hearts content.
